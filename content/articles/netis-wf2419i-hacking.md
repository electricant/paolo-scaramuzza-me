## Introduction

I had an old (2014-ish) and cheap (if I recall correctly it cost me around 15-20
€) Netis WF2419I [\[1\]][1] router collecting dust in a cabinet at home. Its
performance has always been lackluster with the WiFi connection dropping and
restarting every few minutes. I bought it to serve as a guest AP for my dorm
while I was studying in Padova. It worked dutifully for a few years there but, 
after I moved, I've never used it any more and switched to a whole different
setup (which I hope to describe in another post) with more powerful hardware.

This router was almost forgotten, until I read an excellent article by George
Hilliard [\[2\]][2] about hacking Reolink cameras. I had no plans to use this 
device in any case, given that it is rather old and crappy. So reading the
article was enough to spark my interest in trying to reverse engineer and add
as much new functionality as possible to this piece of hardware (or, perhaps,
should I say "junk"?). It surely won't be missed if something goes wrong in the
process.

First off I set myself some goals to keep me on track:
 1. Open the router and identify chipset, RAM, FLASH size and serial port
 2. Dump the flash contents and inspect them
 3. Rebuild a bootable image from the extracted contents and flash it
 4. Setup a working buildroot image and compile a statically-linked busybox
 5. Compile a (hopefully working) custom kernel for the device 

As you can see, each goal somewhat depends on the previous one. Moreover, it's
my first time that I try something like this and some of those goals are not
easy. Murphy's law gets you every time and I have encountered many roadblocks 
during this journey. In writing, I will not spare any of the details, including
the __MANY__ failed attempts. That's why I'm calling this page a diary.

At the time of writing I'm quite far from completion and I have somewhat
abandoned the project. I may reboot it in the future so, perhaps, I might 
decide to split this post into a series.

All the code and raw notes I have produced are available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/electricant/netis-wf2419-router-hacking).

## Opening up the Device & Talking to the Serial Port

Opening the device and finding the serial port has been the easy part. 
Actually, before rushing to the screwdriver to open the chassis, I searched for 
the FCC ID of the device on the back of the unit. Every RF device needs to be
FCC certified to be sold and imported in the US [\[3\]][3] and this router is
no exception. I found the FCC ID on the lower-right corner of the label:
__T58WF2419R__. By searching for this ID on the
[official FCC website](https://www.fcc.gov/oet/ea/fccid) or on
[fccid.io](https://fccid.io/T58WF2419R) I already had access to many low-level
details about the router, including internal photos, without the need to open
it. Not that opening it was a big deal. The warranty is already expired so no
worries.

Stop wandering around the FCC website reading test reports! Given my goals, I
need access to the flash chip so I have to open the device anyway. This was
as easy as just removing the two screws on the bottom side (one is hidden by the
mandatory 'warranty void if seal is broken' sticker, about which I couldn't care
less) and popping open the case.

With the case open, the following components appeared before me onto the sea of
green of the board and are highlighted in the picture below:
 * Realtek RTL8196C - the main router chipset
 * Realtek RTL8192CE - WiFi chipset
 * Winbond W25Q32FV - 32Mbit (4MB) SPI FLASH memory
 * ESMT M12L128168A - 2M x 16 Bit x 4 Banks (16MB) SDRAM
 * A few test points, probably for JTAG and UART access

</figure>

The usual first step is to see if a serial port is exposed somewhere on the
board in order to have access to a shell on the device. As shown in the picture
above, just by looking at the board, I already identified a few suitable
testpoints. Just to be sure and also for future use, I looked up on my
favourite search engine for the main router chipset datasheet. As expected,
somebody (thank you!) released a confidential copy of the document [\[4\]][4].
I neglected all the other details for the moment and scrolled right-ahead to the
pinout, looking for a serial port of some kind.

</figure>

In the above picture I cut the relevant part of the datasheet, showing the
pinout of the chip. In the bottom-right part there are two pins (pin 36
and 37) labelled <b>UART\_RX/GPIOA7</b> and <b>UART\_TX/GPIOB0</b>
respectively. Those pins can be configured either as GPIOs (for controlling the
router LEDs etc.) or as a serial port. I traced those two pins with a multimeter
and they are routed to the unpopulated header labelled __J1__. Most likely,
they are the serial port I'm looking for. Time to solder a pin header and
connect a TTL to USB adapter and see who's there. But HEY! Wait! What's the baud
rate? A quick check with an oscilloscope revealed it's __38400bps__. I know
using an oscilloscope for this task it's a bit of an overkill, but I had one on
hand so why not using it? By the way, some trial and error works too.

After connecting a TTL to serial adapter and issuing

Good. It looks like the router offers a root command prompt on the serial port.
I poked around a bit and tried some commands to gain some info on the
hardware and software of the device:

	dev		lib		proc		sys			usr		web

	# mount

Quite an ancient software stack. Isn't it?

Now that I have grabbed some basic information about the system it's time to
move on and see what's inside the flash chip.

## Dumping The Flash Contents

I had already identified the chip by visual inspection while opening the router:
it is a Winbond W25Q32FV chip. Time to download its datasheet [\[5\]][5] to get
the pinout and connect it to my beloved Bus Pirate [\[6\]][6]. The Bus Pirate
is a small and useful board to talk to and interact with digital stuff. Out of
the box it supports the following interfaces: 1-Wire, 2-Wire, 3-Wire, I2C, SPI,
JTAG, UART and LCD. Alternatively, the GPIO pins can be directly controlled and
many more protocols can be added using aftermarket firmware images since it is
all open source.

<figure>

	<img src="/img/articles/wf2419_hacking/flash_pinout.gif"/>
</a>
<figcaption>Winbond W25Q32FV flash chip pinout.</figcaption>
</figure>

Now that I know the pinout of the chip, I have to figure out how to connect it
for __flashrom__ [\[7\]][7] to read it. I'll try In-System Programming
(ISP) [\[8\]][8] first since it is much quicker and does not require reworking
the board every time I have to read or write the flash contents. If this won't
work the only solution is to desolder and resolder the flash chip from the board
every time. This is time consuming and I'd like to avoid it at all cost.

By means of a quick reverse engineering of the traces around the chip, I found
out that pin 3 and pin 7 (__/WP__ and __/HOLD__ respectively) which, according
to [\[7\]][7] should be connected to 3.3V on the bus pirate, are already tied to
the VCC pin (pin 8). Therefore, only 6 out of the 8 required wires have to be
connected.

After twenty minutes spent with my trusty soldering iron and a piece of an old
ATA cable (the 80-wire version which uses smaller conductors) and I have
created a nice little connector ready to be plugged into the Bus Pirate socket.

<figure>

	<img src="/img/articles/wf2419_hacking/flash_buspirate.jpg"/>
</a>
<figcaption>Bus Pirate ISP connection to the flash chip.</figcaption>
</figure>

To check for a successful connection I issued the following command:

	$ sudo flashrom -p buspirate_spi:dev=/dev/ttyUSB0,spispeed=2M
	[sudo] password for pol: 
	flashrom v1.2 on Linux 5.7.0-2-amd64 (x86_64)
	flashrom is free software, get the source code at https://flashrom.org

	Using clock_gettime for delay loops (clk_id: 1, resolution: 1ns).
	Found Winbond flash chip "W25Q32.V" (4096 kB, SPI) on buspirate_spi.
	No operations were specified.

Hurray! The flash chip was recognized correctly. Time to dump its contents.
	
	$ sudo flashrom -p buspirate_spi:dev=/dev/ttyUSB0,spispeed=2M -r firmware_orig.bin

To see what's inside the image named __firmware\_orig.bin__ I extracted it
recursively with the following command. At the end of the process binwalk
creates a folder named __\_firmware\_orig.bin.extracted__ containing the
files extracted from the various file systems it found.

	$ binwalk -e firmware_orig.bin 

	DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION

Or that was the expectation. What are those warnings and why is my folder
__squashfs-root__ empty?  Apparently sasquatch is not installed in my
system and

	$ sudo apt search sasquatch

does not return any result. Alright it's not the first time I have to compile
and install something from source on my system. It's strange however that the
Debian repos are missing this useful piece of software. Perhaps I could
volunteer as its maintainer? Not today. I have a router to hack now. Sasquatch
is downloaded from [\[9\]][9] and __build.sh__ does all the requisite stuff for
building and installing.

As usual, the process is never as easy as running a single command. The build
failed with a ton of messages like the following:

	/usr/bin/ld: unsquashfs_xattr.o:/tmp/article/sasquatch/squashfs4.3/squashfs-tools/error.h:34: multiple definition of `verbose'; unsquashfs.o:/tmp/article/sasquatch/squashfs4.3/squashfs-tools/error.h:34: first defined here
	collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
	make: *** [Makefile:298: sasquatch] Error 1

By looking at the issues and pull requests of sasquatch I found
[pull request #34](https://github.com/devttys0/sasquatch/pull/34) which should
fix the issue. After applying it to my local copy of the code the compilation
is successful. I'm now ready to go ahead with the extraction.

Great. The image contains some LZMA compressed data, probably kernel and
bootloader, and a squashfs file system [\[10\]][10]. This time binwalk
recursively extracted those files and what I got was in fact a kernel (version
2.4.18 of course), some certificates and the contents of the root file system. I
was now able to inspect and modify the image contents as I please. The expert
reader (or my future self if he learned something from this endeavour) may
already have noticed the first mistake here. If nothing above looks wrong fasten
your seat belt we're going deep down a rabbit hole.

## Rebuilding the Flash Image and First Roadblocks

This is the root folder structure of the extracted image:

	$ ls -l _firmware_orig.bin.extracted/squashfs-root/
	total 0
	drwxr-xr-x 2 pol pol 3580 Jun 30  2015 bin

	drwxrwxrwx 3 pol pol  600 Jun 30  2015 etc

	drwxrwxrwx 2 pol pol   40 Jun 30  2015 var
	drwxr-xr-x 8 pol pol  300 Jun 30  2015 web
	
To test if the image extraction and rebuild processes work correctly, the 
easiest thing to do is modify the __index.htm__ file of the router configuration
webpage and add some test code to it. I copied the directory
__firmware\_orig.bin.extracted__ and its contents to
__firmware.extracted\_new__ in order to preserve the original files. Then I
modified __firmware.extracted\_new/squashfs-root/web/index.htm__ by
appending the following lines just before the closing html tag.
	
	<script>
		alert("I have been pwned!");
	</script>

This should display an alert window as soon as the page is loaded.

Save and close (:wq) and that's it. Now it's time to rebuild the image and see 
if it boots. But before attempting to re-create it, I needed more details about
the file system structure.

### The Lazy Way (Failed)

The first root file system creation attempt I did was using the version of 
squashfs-tools provided by the Debian packages (version 4.4 at the time of
writing).

	$ mksquashfs squashfs-root D0000.new.squashfs -b 65536 -all-root -noappend

	$ unsquashfs -s D0000.new.squashfs 
	Found a valid SQUASHFS 4:0 superblock on D0000.new.squashfs.
	Creation or last append time [... redacted ...]
	Filesystem size 2788625 bytes (2723.27 Kbytes / 2.66 Mbytes)
	Compression gzip
	Block size 65536
	Filesystem is exportable via NFS
	Inodes are compressed
	Data is compressed
	Uids/Gids (Id table) are compressed
	Fragments are compressed
	Always-use-fragments option is not specified
	Xattrs are compressed
	Duplicates are removed
	Number of fragments 26
	Number of inodes 366
	Number of ids 1

Apart from the different superblock version, we have that the file system size
is bigger, the endianness is gone and the number of inodes is lower than the
original image. What is going on? I decided to tackle one issue at a time.

First of all is the squashfs file system backwards-compatible? Apparently,
SquashFS v4.0 moved to a fixed little-endian format (even for big-endian
systems). Given the differences, the odds of the new image booting are already
quite low. For the sake of science I decided to test the new image anyway.

	$ cp ../firmware_orig.bin firmware_pwned.bin
	$ dd if=D0000.new.squashfs of=firmware_pwned.bin bs=1 seek=$((0xD0000)) conv=notrunc
	$ sudo flashrom -p buspirate_spi:dev=/dev/ttyUSB0,spispeed=2M -w firmware.extracted_new/firmware_pwned.bin 

And sure enough when I turned on the router, carefully monitoring the serial 
output, the device was unable to mount the root file system and it was stuck in
a bootloop.

### The Hard Way

Of course it could not be so easy. I needed an older version of squashfs,
supporting setting a different endianness. Is there a different/lower version of
squashfs-tools in the Debian repos? Of course not. I had to compile it my own.
Who cares I'm already used to that. The first thing I did was to download the
[squashfs sources for version 2.2-r2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/squashfs/files/squashfs/squashfs2.2-r2/).
And once again the stock sources cannot be compiled with gcc 10. I learned, 
after trial and error, that this is due to different gcc behaviour and
due to some symbols moved to different header files. To get this squashfs-tools
version compile on my system I had to apply the following changes:

	$ diff -u squashfs2.2-r2/squashfs-tools squashfs-tools

	 #include <errno.h>

Figuring out why the code was not building and what to do to make gcc accept it
took me quite a while. However, now that I have a working copy of mksquashfs 
version 2, I tried again to rebuild the file system:

	$ squashfs/squashfs2.2-r2/squashfs-tools/mksquashfs squashfs-root D0000.new.squashfs -b 65536 -all-root -noappend -2.0 -be

	Duplicates are removed
	Number of fragments 26
	Number of inodes 366
	Number of uids 1
	Number of gids 0

The issue about endianness and superblock version were solved. There was still a
different number of inodes and a bigger file system size. But hey, who cares
right? I flashed it into the router right-away, repeating the steps in the
previous section, but the device is still stuck in a boot loop.

What are those missing inodes anyway? I thought that maybe extracting the
SquashFS file system manually will yield more information.

	$ unsquashfs D0000.squashfs 
	Reading a different endian SQUASHFS filesystem on D0000.squashfs
	read_ids: Bad inode count in super block
	File system corruption detected
	FATAL ERROR:failed to read file system tables

Now I'm getting why binwalk was using sasquatch to extract the root file system
image. Let's do the same

	$ sasquatch D0000.squashfs 
	SquashFS version [512.0] / inode count [-2063532032] suggests a SquashFS image of a different endianess

This was one of those moments when you realize you were barking up the wrong
tree all the time. Facepalm. The missing inodes are the character devices
[\[11\]][11]. Of course nothing will boot! Upon extraction, binwalk did not
have the required permissions to create such files. I have to extract the file
system as root to get the whole contents of the image:

	$ sudo sasquatch D0000.squashfs 
	[sudo] password for pol: 
	SquashFS version [512.0] / inode count [-2063532032] suggests a SquashFS image of a different endianess

	created 237 files
	created 20 directories
	created 109 symlinks
	created 23 devices
	created 0 fifos

Now we are talking! Well... not really. I rebuilt the file system once again
as I did before, the only difference now is file system size. However, the
router is still stuck in a bootloop. A quick check confirmed that the size of 
the final flash image fits in the flash chip, so the file system size was not 
the issue. It was a symptom of the issue instead: what was still missing was 
the correct compression algorithm for mksquashfs. The version 2.2 of mksquashfs
does not support lzma compression by default. A working copy of squashfs-lzma
[\[12\]][12] was needed. I was fed up of blindly trying stuff until something
works, so I downloaded the GPL code [\[13\]][13] (thanks Richard Stallman) for
my router model and started inspecting the package contents to find some clues
about how the flash image is built. 

### GPL Code is Fun

Inside the package I found the directory
__GPL\_Code\_RTL/rtl819x-sdk-v1.2/AP/squashfs-tools__ containing some sources
for mksquashfs. After copying it somewhere else to preserve the original files, 
I had to patch the code inside the new directory in a similar fashion as
SquashFS 2.2-r2.

	$ diff -ru squashfs-tools-orig squashfs-tools/

After that, I compiled the sources with <tt>make</tt> and I got a fancy new 
executable to play with: __mksquashfs-lzma__. It can be used to build the new
file system as usual.

	$ squashfs/squashfs-tools/mksquashfs-lzma squashfs-root D0000.new.squashfs -b 65536 -all-root -noappend -be

After flashing the new image, this time the router booted successfully. I 
pointed my browser to the configuration page (available at
__http://192.168.1.1__ by default) and logged in with the default credentials.
The following webpage appeared.

	<figcaption>Success! A pwned index.htm appears.</figcaption>
</figure>

Hurray! This meant that I could do whatever I wanted with the root file system!
To avoid manually entering a series of commands every time I want to build a
new image, I created a small script available on GitHub [\[14\]][14].

## Compiling Software and More Roadblocks

This page is getting long already. Let's recap the ultimate goal: compile a 
custom kernel for the device. To do so, I need a working compiler for the 
architecture. This process is streamlined by buildroot: *a set of Makefiles and
patches that simplifies and automates the process of building a complete and
bootable Linux environment for an embedded system* [\[15\]][15]. Buildroot
downloads and builds the toolchain and utilities it needs for compiling software
for the target architecture, applies custom patches to the sources, compiles the
software and assembles the final bootable image.

To test the compiler is working, I decided to build a new version of busybox
with some added functionality using buildroot. So, the first thing I did was to
clone the latest stable buildroot release (2020.08.1 at the time of writing)
with
	
	$ git clone git://git.buildroot.net/buildroot $ cd buildroot $ git
	checkout 2020.08.1

Then, I tried to build a statically-linked busybox executable with some nice
additions to the stock one on the router (such as telnet) using
__MIPS (big endian)__ as the target architecture and the stock
__Generic MIPS32__ target architecture variant for buildroot. The command I
used are the following:

	$ make menuconfig
	/* 
	   Select the desided architecture and build options
	   Especially:
		Target options -> Target Architecture -> MIPS (big endian)
		               -> Target Architecture Variant -> Generic MIPS32
		Build options -> libraries -> static only
	*/

	$ make busybox-menuconfig
	/* 
	   Enable telnetd and disable all the stuff we don't need to make the
	   busybox executable small
	*/
	
	$ make
	/* have a coffe break */

After a few minutes, I found the compiled busybox executable in
__buildroot/output/target/bin__. I copied it as __busybox\_p__ (to 
avoid confusion with the original executable) to the extracted firmware image
and created a symlink to it named __telnetd__. I rebuilt the image as I did
many times, flashed it and let the router boot. Sadly this was the result when
running the new executable from the serial terminal.

	# busybox_p
	Illegal instruction
	# telnetd
	Illegal instruction

Why can't this stuff just work? Maybe the endianness of the executable is wrong,
all in all I just guessed it. In the extracted firmware image directory on my PC
I ran:

	$ file busybox
	busybox: ELF 32-bit MSB executable, MIPS, MIPS-I version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-uClibc.so.0, stripped
	$ file busybox_p
	busybox_p: ELF 32-bit MSB executable, MIPS, MIPS-I version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, stripped

So the endianness was indeed correct. However, according to the chipset
datasheet&#8239;[\[4\]][4] and some other web resources, the illegal 
instruction the device was encountering may be due to the core which is a 
RLX4181 Lexra architecture&#8239;[\[16\]][16], a variant of the MIPS32 
architecture lacking the __lwl, lwr, swl__ and __swr__ instructions, covered by
an US patent.

Time to dig into the search engine once again. The following links seemed to
point to some useful code:
* [hackpascal/0001-binutils-2.24-add-lexra-support.patch](https://gist.github.com/hackpascal/c07dd5e3745f90b45e5ed6c1e86fde41)
* [Working Realtek SoC RTL8196E 97D 97F in last master - For Developers - OpenWrt Forum](https://forum.openwrt.org/t/working-realtek-soc-rtl8196e-97d-97f-in-last-master/70975)
* [rlx-router/openwrt-rtl8196c](https://github.com/rlx-router/openwrt-rtl8196c)
* [rlx-router/linux-rlx-upstream](https://github.com/rlx-router/linux-rlx-upstream)
* [shibajee/buildroot-rlx4181](https://github.com/shibajee/buildroot-rlx4181)

The last link contains a complete buildroot repository allegedly supporting the
RLX4181 architecture. I added it to my buildroot folder, cleaned it and rebuilt
it once again:

	git remote add https://notabug.org/shibajee/buildroot
	git remote add -f rlx4181-notabug https://notabug.org/shibajee/buildroot
	git checkout rlx4181-master
	make clean
	make menuconfig
	/* Select the correct architecture and build options */
	make -j4
	
After a while the executable files were ready. I ran __objdump -D__ on the
output executables, grepping for the instructions which are not accepted
by the processor. Those commands did not turn any result.
	
	objdump -D root/bin/busybox_p | grep lwl
	objdump -D root/bin/busybox_p | grep lwr
	objdump -D root/bin/busybox_p | grep swl
	objdump -D root/bin/busybox_p | grep swr

Now I was really confident that this time everything will have worked as 
expected so I rebuilt the flash image and flashed onto the chip. Sadly I was
greeted again by the darn __Illegal instruction__ message.

I was starting to suspect that the error was due to the wrong kernel headers 
version. The actual kernel header files for the Linux version running on the
device are available in the GPL code package. So, within my buildroot folder, I
issued:

	make uclibc-menuconfig

To edit the uclibc .config file and set a different directory to fetch the
kernel headers.

Pointing uclibc to the original (and quite old) kernel headers did not work
either. This time I was unable successfully compile buildroot because I got a
bunch of undeclared identifiers in many libraries. This is probably due to the
kernel headers lacking the symbols required by the new software I was trying to
compile.

## Conclusion

Eventually this has been too much for me. I'm calling it quits here. Porting
newer software to the older kernel headers to fix the compilation errors is a 
tedious job. Another option could be to port a newer kernel to the device, but
all the kernel sources available on github seem to compile successfully but do
not boot properly.

Alternatively, I could try to use an older buildroot version. I have no idea if
there is any buildroot version compatible with the Linux kernel version 2.4.
This can be easily fixed by searching within the git repository. However, I will
have to manually port the binutils patches to correctly compile software for
this unorthodox MIPS architecture. And this again is tedious.

I think the effort required to go further with this project is becoming too much
and it is not worth it any more. Some progress has already been made by the
OpenWrt folks albeit on a different processor revision (see links in the
previous section) so I may reboot this project in the future.

All in all, I learned a lot already and no electronic devices were harmed in the
process. So, even though I hit only 3 out of the 5 objectives I set at the
start, I'm quite satisfied. It was still a valid learning experience. It's time
to try to hack another router, maybe I will be luckier this time (stay tuned).
